      <h1>Your Guide to Proper Roof Ventilation in California Homes</h1>
      <p>
        In California, effective roof ventilation is essential due to the state’s diverse climate conditions. Proper ventilation is not just a building code requirement; it is key to preserving the longevity of your home and maintaining comfort for your family.
      </p>

      <h2>Understanding the Basics of Roof Ventilation</h2>
      <p>
        Roof ventilation ensures continuous airflow in your attic. The general rule is 1 square foot of vent area for every 300 square feet of attic space, split between intake vents (at the eaves) and exhaust vents (near the roof peak). This system helps manage temperature and moisture throughout the year.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Proper Ventilation Matters in California</h2>
      <p>California’s climate presents distinct challenges for homeowners:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Moisture Management:</strong> Activities like cooking, showering, and even breathing generate moisture that can accumulate in your attic. Without proper ventilation, this moisture can lead to mold growth, rust, and roof decay.</li>
        <li><strong>Temperature Control:</strong> California summers can create extreme attic heat. Proper ventilation helps:
          <ul>
            <li>Reduce attic temperatures</li>
            <li>Lower air conditioning costs</li>
            <li>Prevent heat damage to roofing materials</li>
            <li>Extend the lifespan of your roof</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Types of Vents and Their Benefits</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Soffit Vents:</strong> Located under the eaves to bring in cooler air.</li>
        <li><strong>Ridge Vents:</strong> Positioned at the roof’s peak, helping hot air escape and promoting airflow.</li>
        <li><strong>Box and Fascia Vents:</strong> Alternatives to ridge vents, especially in homes without a ridge line. Attic fans can also be used in place of or in addition to other vents.</li>
      </ul>
