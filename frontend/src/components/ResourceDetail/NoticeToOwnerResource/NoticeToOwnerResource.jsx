      <h1>Understanding a Notice to Owner</h1>
      <p>This law protects the homeowner from paying for their materials twice.</p>
      <p>
        Under Californiaâ€™s construction lien law, a Notice to Owner is a preliminary notice provided to the property owner. It is typically used by subcontractors and other construction-related entities that do not have a direct contract with the property owner. This document ensures the homeowner is informed about the services and materials being provided, which could potentially lead to a lien if payment issues arise.
